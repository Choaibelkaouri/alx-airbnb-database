## üéØ Objective
Master SQL joins by writing complex queries using different types of joins (INNER, LEFT, and FULL OUTER JOIN).

## üß† Instructions
1. Write a query using an **INNER JOIN** to retrieve all bookings and the respective users who made those bookings.  
2. Write a query using a **LEFT JOIN** to retrieve all properties and their reviews, including properties that have no reviews.  
3. Write a query using a **FULL OUTER JOIN** to retrieve all users and all bookings, even if the user has no booking or a booking is not linked to a user.
